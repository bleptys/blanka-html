# Blanka: simple HTML/CSS baseline

Blanka is the second step for your web project, just after [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/).

Design principles: 

1. Both webpages and webapps are based on web documents.
2. Good typography is a necessary foundation for document.
3. Simple is better than robust.

Unlike other CSS baselines (such as Bootstrap's [Reboot](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/content/reboot/) or [Pure CSS](http://purecss.io/)), Blanka.css do not set look and feel. Font stack, typographic scale, table and forms looks is on you. 

Blanka contains three files:

- [blanka.html](blanka.html): blank HTML template
- [blanka.css](blanka.css): typography CSS baseline
- [blanka-type-test.html](blanka-type-test.html): typography HTML stress test (also [Czech version](blanka-type-test.cz.html))
